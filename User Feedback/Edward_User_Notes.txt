Our first user, Shannon began her test by commenting the the design "looks fine", and found the game overall enjoyable. She had
some trouble with the submit button, thinking that it did not work. However, she soon realized her mistake. She found it "really easy to
use" and stated "I love the colors" and "the blue is nice". She especially liked the "really helpful bold letters" and found that it to
be a "fun game".

Our second user Porter, stated "I haven't played Sudoku in so long" and that it was "so hard". He asked about a subscript option, which
we may consider implementing in the future. He stated "numbers input well" and was glad that the return button also functioned as 
a submit button. He went as far as saying it was "almost fun" and "the best he has ever done in Sudoku". His final remark was that it 
was a "good game".

Our third user, Julia started off the game by planning her strategy. She stated she was going to "start with the ones" but later stated it
was a "bad idea" and then that she "found a two". She seemed very engaged in the game, but requested that we make the screen larger, so 
we increased the size of the gui after her test. She said the game "works well" even if she wasnt good at Sudoku.
